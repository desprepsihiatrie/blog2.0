ro.bert here.

I am generally interested in anything that doesn't reduce my optionality and things that you can do once that work in perpetuity.

My work revolves around *spaces*—both *the digital* and *physical* places we inhabit in our everyday lives: *interfaces*, *cyberspace*, *cities*, and the like

This page is a basic tl;dr of my philosophical foundation.

I weave metaphors, explore open questions, and [write](/writing) occasionally about my discoveries. I'd love to show you around some of my [projects](/projects) sometime!

*Please*, make your self at home,

  **Part II**
		- 1. Other humans exist.
		- 2. Other humans have an experience like mine.

  **Part III**

		- 2. If I synergize with others, it will maximize my experience.
		- 3. Others will synergize with me to maximize their experience.
