ro.bert here.

I am generally interested in anything that doesn't reduce my optionality and things that you can do once that work in perpetuity.

My work revolves around *spaces*—both *the digital* and *physical* places we inhabit in our everyday lives: *interfaces*, *cyberspace*, *cities*, and the like

This page is a basic tl;dr of my philosophical foundation.

I weave metaphors, explore open questions, and [write](/writing) occasionally about my discoveries. I'd love to show you around some of my [projects](/projects) sometime!

*Please*, make your self at home,

### Foundations
  **Part I**
  
  I exist.
  I have an experience.
  I want to maximize my experience.
  
  **Part II**
  
  Other humans exist.
  Other humans have an experience like mine.
  Other humans want to maximize their experience.
 
  **Part III**
  
  Humans synergize to create better experiences.
  If I synergize with others, it will maximize my experience.
  Others will synergize with me to maximize their experience.

### **On Age**

	- Age really is just an anxiety-inducing number. Feeling like you need to have your life figured out by the time you're 20, comparing yourself to other people your age, stressing about turning 30, and feeling like you are officially no longer "young". A way for people to put you into a convenient box.
	- I understand that if you want to function in society, you need to keep track of things. Sometimes I feel like I do not even need to have a name. If I have a group of people that really know me, they don't need to call me anything. I suppose I like not to be bound by stuff that other people bring on you.
	- There is no day, there is no night. I am trying not to bind myself to the arbitrary calculations of cycles and sequences which are ultimately imaginary. It is easier for me to say that a day doesn't end when the moon is out, and the day doesn't begin when the sun rises. It is all a continuous flow. Not chopped up into pieces.
	- I do enjoy being alone and have a tendency toward a solitary or sheltered lifestyle.
	- I am indeed a walking contradiction.
