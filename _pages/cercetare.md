Știu că majoritatea oamenilor nu prea au chef să citească articole academice plictisitoare. Dar, ca medic, consider că este important ca noi toți să înțelegem știința din spatele diagnosticelor și tratamentelor psihiatrice. Așa că am decis să fac treaba asta mai ușoară pentru voi, adunând aici cele mai fascinante studii pe care le găsesc.

Nu vă faceți griji, nu voi posta doar texte plictisitoare! Voi incerca să explic pe înțelesul tuturor informațiile esențiale și să evidențiez cele mai interesante descoperiri. Totodată, voi adăuga și propriile mele comentarii, ca să nu adormiți citind.

Please stop saying you researched it.  
You didn’t research anything and it is highly probable you don’t know how to do so. Did you compile a literature review and write abstracts on each article? Or better yet, did you collect a random sample of sources and perform independent probability statistics on the reported results? No? Did you at least take each article one by one and look into the source (that would be the author, publisher and funder), then critique the writing for logical fallacies, cognitive distortions and plain inaccuracies? Did you ask yourself why this source might publish these particular results? Did you follow the trail of references and apply the same source of scrutiny to them? No? Then you didn’t … research anything. You read or watched a video, most likely with little or no objectivity. You came across something in your algorithm manipulated feed, something that jived with your implicit biases and served your confirmation bias, and subconsciously applied your emotional filters and called it proof.
